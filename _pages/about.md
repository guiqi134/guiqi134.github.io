Hey, thanks for checking my site!

My name is Song Zhang (张嵩 in Chinese). I'm a PhD student in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. I completed my Master study (Spring 2022) also at the University of Utah, advised by Dr. [Cem Yuksel](http://www.cemyuksel.com/). I got my Bachelor's degree from New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) and Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT). My current research focus is designing efficient sampling and reusing algorithm for real-time path tracing. 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing console games ([Remedy's Control](https://www.remedygames.com/games/control/) is my favorite game over recent years), listening to eletronic music, watching films and cooking. I'm also a big fan of japanese animation!
