Hey, thanks for checking my site!

My name is Song Zhang (张嵩 in Chinese). I'm now a first year PhD student in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. I completed my Master study (Spring 2022) also at the University of Utah, advised by Dr. [Cem Yuksel](http://www.cemyuksel.com/). My research focus is real-time rendering and physically-based rendering, but I'm also interested in other fields like simulation, differential geometry and neural network stuff.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing console games ([Remedy's Control](https://www.remedygames.com/games/control/) is my favorite game in recent years), listening to eletronic music, watching films and cooking. I'm also a big fan of japanese animation.
